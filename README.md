git NAI_Stack_Regression # A cmd for linux reproducibility
The SMILES-based dataset is stored in Raw_NAI_IC50.csv
Feature representations can be derived from both handcrafted features and Mol2Vec embeddings (as Handcraft Descriptor.ipynb and Mol2Vec Embedding.ipynb).
The probabilistic feature is formulated using Stacking Representation.ipynb.
Hybrid multiview regression can be performed within Multiview Regressor.ipynb.
The files for Multiview Regressor.ipynb are in Regression.
